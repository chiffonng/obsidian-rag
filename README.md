# Chat with My Second Brain

This repository contains the code for a Q&A system that generate answers to questions based on the knowledge from my second brain. The [original report](report.pdf) was produced as part of Minerva University course ["Finding Patterns in Data with Machine Learning" (CS156)](https://www.minerva.edu/concentrations/data-science-and-statistics/) Fall 2023.

I refactored the code from Jupyter Notebook to Python scripts and added a few more features

- Added tests for data processing
- [ ] Change the naive RAG infrastructure to agentic RAG to improve the performance on more complex queries, such as multi-hop questions
- [ ] Change to public data to turn this project into an experimental setting

## Tools and Technologies

- Language: Python 3.11
- Framework: LlamaIndex
- LLM: OpenAI API Mistral model
