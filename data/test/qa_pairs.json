Intuitively, gradient descent is like finding the lowest point in a hilly landscape. Imagine you're on a hill, and you want to reach the lowest point (minimum). You start at any random spot on the hill, look around, feel the slope, and walk small steps in the steepest direction. You repeat this process until you reach the lowest point, where the slope is nearly flat. You've found the minimum!",
